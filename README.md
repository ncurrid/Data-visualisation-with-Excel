# Data visualisation with Excel
# I. Context
Following a significant number of customer departures, Primero Bank tasked us with conducting a data analysis of their customer relationship management software.

The objective of this analysis was twofold:

- To identify common characteristics among the customers who had left the bank.

- To estimate the proportion of current customers who are at risk of leaving in the near future.

Based on these insights, Primero Bank intended to develop an action plan to reduce customer churn and prevent another wave of departures.

# II. Methodology
## 1. Defined communication objectives
In this initial phase, we focused on understanding:

- The bank’s objectives in requesting our data analysis expertise.

- The target audience for the resulting communication (e.g., internal management, customer service teams).

- The goals of the communication, which include raising awareness, informing strategy, and guiding decision-making with clear, actionable insights.

## 2. Transformed data into information
We began by cleaning and exploring the Primero Bank database. This involved:

- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, standardising formats, and removing duplicates.

- Data visualisation: Creating initial plots to better understand trends.

- Data analysis using a range of tools and techniques, such as: statistical functions, filters, aggregations, pivot tables.

The purpose was to identify patterns in customer behavior, especially among those who left the bank, and to estimate the proportion of current customers at risk of leaving.

## 3. Data visualisation
To support our findings, we created clear and effective visualisations, making it easier for stakeholders to interpret the results. Our approach included:

Building graphs and charts based on pivot table outputs, ensuring the visualisations were easy to read and interpret by:

- Using clear titles and legends

- Labeling axes with understandable terms

- Applying contrasting colors to highlight key data

- Using different types of visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, line graphs) depending on the nature of the data and the insights to be communicated.

## 4. Present of ther results to the Client
In the final stage, we focused on:

- Selecting the most relevant and impactful results to present.

- Linking each result directly to the client’s objectives, ensuring that the analysis supported decision-making.

- Preparing a written report and presentation slides that avoid technical jargon. Since the client is not from a technical background, we prioritised clear and simple explanations.
